The code you provided has a few errors. First, the `result` variable is never assigned a value. This means that the `console.log` statement at the end will print `undefined`. Second, the `reduce` function is not being used correctly. The `acc` variable is being used as a local variable, but it should be declared as an object. Finally, the `evens` and `odds` arrays are not being initialized.

Here is the fixed code:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
​
const result = {
  evens: [],
  odds: []
};
​
const evens = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
});
​
const odds = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 !== 0) {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
});
​
console.log(result);
​
```

This code will print the following output:
  evens: [2, 4],
  odds: [1, 3, 5]
