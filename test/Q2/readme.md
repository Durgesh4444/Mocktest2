#### The output of the above-given code is:

5 5 5 5 5

This is because the var keyword declares a variable in the global scope, which means that the value of i is shared by all the iterations of the for loop. When the setTimeout function is executed, it reads the current value of i, which is 5 after the loop ends. To get the expected output of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, you need to use the let keyword, which declares a variable in the block scope, or use a closure to create a local scope for each iteration
