#### cokies - suppose when we are on login page their is always one opition is available that is remember me and submit it send request to server and server genrate a session Id and that session id will get stored in side cokies. the benifit of this that when user tries to login next time it does not send sny request to server it just check with your previous id password and allowed to login. now a days lots of developer used it to store what user recently searched on their website to know their requiements ex. amzon, flipkart
#### local storage - in local storage  all the data store permanantly until any one delete it 

#### session storage - in session storage data store till browser is open only
