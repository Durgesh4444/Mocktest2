The code will output the following to the console:

```javascript

array 1: length=4 last=n
array 2: length=7 last=s
```


This is because the first line of code creates an array called `arr1` that contains the letters "j", "o", "h", and "n". The second line of code reverses the order of the letters in `arr1` and stores the result in an array called `arr2`. The third line of code creates an array called `arr3` that contains the letters "j", "o", "n", and "e". The fourth line of code adds the letters in `arr3` to the end of `arr2`. The fifth and sixth lines of code print the length and last element of each array to the console.
