The output will be:

1

4

2

3

>Explanation:
In the first console.log statement, the output is 1.
In the second console.log statement, the output is 4.
In the setTimeout function, the second argument is the function to be executed after the specified time interval. In this case, the first argument is the function to be executed, which is printNumber. The third argument is the value that will be passed as an argument to the function. In this case, the value is 2.
The setTimeout function schedules the execution of the function printNumber after 100 milliseconds. Therefore, the output of the code will be:

1

4

2

3

After 100 milliseconds, the function printNumber is executed with the value 2.
Then, the third console.log statement is executed with the value 3.
Finally, the fourth console.log statement is executed with the value 4.
