Callback hell is a situation in which a series of callbacks are nested within each other, making the code difficult to read and understand. This can happen when a function calls another function, which calls another function, and so on. Each time a function is called, it passes its return value as a parameter to the next function. This can quickly lead to a complex and confusing web of callbacks.

There are a few different ways to solve callback hell. One way is to use promises. Promises are a way of representing the eventual completion of an asynchronous operation. They allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together, without having to worry about nested callbacks.

Here is an example of how to use promises to solve callback hell:


```javascript
function getProducts() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Make an asynchronous request to get the products.
    $.ajax({
      url: "/products",
      success: function(data) {
        // The products have been retrieved successfully.
        resolve(data);
      },
      error: function(error) {
        // The products could not be retrieved.
        reject(error);
      }
    });
  });
}
```
